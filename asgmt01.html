    <p class="header">Code To Start With</p>
    <p>This assignment provides a you with a .zip file containing the code you should start with. The .zip file will expand into a folder that is set up to be both a BlueJ project and an Eclipse project.</p>
    <p><span class="header">JAR Files</span> </p>
    <p>Java executables are packaged as JAR (<strong>J</strong>ava <strong>AR</strong>chive) files. A JAR file is actually a Zip file. You can open a JAR file with any Zip utility (e.g. <a href="http://7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a>). Once you&rsquo;re ready to submit your work, you will need to create a JAR file containing your code. Both BlueJ and Eclipse have the ability to do this (see the <strong>How To Create a JAR File...</strong> sections below). In order for your work to be graded, your JAR file must be executable from the command line.</p>
    <p>Each JAR file contains a folder named <strong>META-INF</strong>. This folder contains a file named <strong>MANIFEST.MF</strong>, which is the JAR file&rsquo;s &ldquo;manifest file.&rdquo; The manifest file is a text file that specifies which Java class in the JAR file contains the<span class="code"> main()</span> method. The Java Virtual Machine needs this information in order to be able to run your code from the command line.</p>
    <p> You should not change the structure of your project folder <em>in any way</em>. Do not rename files, do not move files to a different folder, do not create new folders or files, etc.</p>
    <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="description" -->
    <p class="header">Collections Framework</p>
    <p>
      <i>
        If you do this assignment correctly, you will not have to
        write a lot of code.  You will just have to use
        the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Collections
        Framework.lbi" -->Collections Framework<!-- #EndLibraryItem
        --> intelligently. &ldquo;Intelligently&rdquo; also means that
        you should pay attention to the storage and time efficiency of
        your code and use the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem
        "/Library/Collections Framework.lbi" -->Collections
        Framework<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->
      </i>
      <span style="font-style: italic">components that are most appropriate to the task your code will be performing. </span>
    </p>
    <p>You are required to use the &ldquo;generics&rdquo; syntax in your code. This means that if you&rsquo;re using (for example) an ArrayList, you should code it like this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="code">List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="font-style: italic">In other words, the data types of the items in your Collections must <u>always</u> be specified between the angle brackets.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic">This requirement is true of all other Java assignments for this course. Anytime it&rsquo;s <u>possible</u> to use the generics syntax, it&rsquo;s <u>required</u>. </p>
    <p><em>Starting with the BlueJ/Eclipse project in asgmt01.zip:</em></p>
    <p>
      Use the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Collections Framework.lbi" -->Collections Framework<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> to write a program that counts how many
      times each <span style="font-style: italic">word pair</span> appears in a text file. A word pair consists of two consecutive words (i.e. a word and the word that directly follows it). In the first sentence of this paragraph, the words &ldquo;counts&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; are a word pair with a <span style="font-style: italic">first word</span> of &ldquo;counts&rdquo; and a <span style="font-style: italic">second word</span> of &ldquo;how.&rdquo; 
    </p>
    <p>For instance, this input to the program: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="code">abc def abc ghi abc def ghi jkl abc xyz abc abc abc --- </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Should produce this output:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre class="code">abc:
   abc, 2
   def, 2
   ghi, 1
   xyz, 1
def:
   abc, 1
   ghi, 1
ghi:
   abc, 1
   jkl, 1
jkl:
   abc, 1
xyz:
   abc, 1</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic">Note that the word </span>&ldquo;---&rdquo;<span style="font-style: italic"> is used as an end-of-input marker, and is not counted as a word. </span></p>
    <p>
      Note that the list of words and each sublist of second words is in alphabetical order. Putting things in alphabetical order is a requirement of the assignment. Do not write your own code for putting
      the output into alphabetical order.  Use the facilities provided in the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/Collections Framework.lbi" -->Collections Framework<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> for that.
    </p>
    <p>The output indicates that the word &ldquo;abc&rdquo; was followed twice by &ldquo;abc,&rdquo; twice by  &ldquo;def,&rdquo; once by  &ldquo;ghi,&rdquo; and once by  &ldquo;xyz.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;ghi&rdquo; was followed once by &ldquo;abc&rdquo; and once by  &ldquo;jkl.&rdquo; Note that the output should be sorted by <span style="font-style: italic">first word</span>, and for each <span style="font-style: italic">first word</span> the output should be sorted by <span style="font-style: italic">second word</span>. </p>
    <p>To get full credit for this assignment, you should process the words in <span style="font-style: italic">one pass</span> (i.e. just go through the words <span style="font-style: italic">one time</span>). What you do to produce the printed output does not count as a &ldquo;pass.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><i>Do not</i> bother with punctuation.  Count words like &ldquo;this.&rdquo; and &ldquo;this&rdquo; as separate
      words.  Do the same with capital and small letters (i.e. &ldquo;this&rdquo; and  &ldquo;This&rdquo; are separate words). For the purposes of this assignment, any sequence of non-whitespace characters is considered to be a word.
    </p>
    <p>Submit your work as <strong>asgmt01.jar</strong>.</p>
    <p>Using amazon.txt as its input, your progam should produce output identical to the contents of <span style="font-weight: bold">asgmt01.output.txt</span>, which is provided with this assignment. </p>
    <span class="header">Testing Your Code</span>
    <p>I will be using the file <strong>amazon.txt</strong> to test your code.  The amazon.txt file is included in <strong>asgmt01.zip</strong>.</p>
    <p>In order to use amazon.txt as the input to your program, type the
      following at the MS-DOS command line:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="code">java -jar asgmt01.jar &lt; amazon.txt</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>By doing this, you will be &ldquo;redirecting&rdquo; the &ldquo;standard input&rdquo; of your program to be amazon.txt,  and 
      the input will come from amazon.txt instead of user type-in.
    </p>
    <p><i>You <b>do not</b> need to write code for opening and reading the
      amazon.txt file.  Either do the &ldquo;redirecting&rdquo; as described above or specify the file name as a command line argument to </i><span class="code">main()</span><i>.</i>
    </p>
    <p class="header">Required JAR File Structure</p>
    <p>Here is the required structure for the .jar file that you will submit for this assignment:</p>
    <table width="90%">
      <tr>
        <td align="left" valign="top">
